- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Because both title and catergory are String type, the constructor sign is the same (constructor(String))). 
So, you can not create two constructor methods with the same sign.

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Java always passes by value.

Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.

- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
	
Lớp `Cart`

public class Cart implements Comparable


- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?

phương thức compareTo() trong lớp Cart chỉ sắp xếp được theo 1 trường: ví như cost, không thể sắp xếp theo 2 trường cost -> title. 

@Override
public int compareTo(Media m)
    {
        return this.cost - m.cost;
    }

- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?

phương thức compareTo() trong lớp Cart chỉ sắp xếp được theo 1 trường: ví như cost, không thể sắp xếp theo 2 trường cost -> title. 

- Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
